<h2>
<a name="the-issue" class="anchor" href="#the-issue"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Issue</h2>

<p>Knowledge Forum is one of the earliest computer-supported collaborative environments to support embedded formative assessment tools. With the current rebuild of Knowledge Forum going on, it becomes important to review where we were and where we are in terms of knowledge building analytics and make informed decisions on where we should be headed in building next-generation analytics.</p>

<h2>
<a name="major-goals" class="anchor" href="#major-goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Major Goals</h2>

<p>This interactive symposium explores theoretical, design, and technological aspects of knowledge building analytics. It systematically reviews analytic tools that have been built for knowledge building. It aims to conceptualize knowledge building analytics based on discussion of epistemology, assessment, pedagogy, and stakeholder needs. Informed by this discussion, it goes further to explore indicators that matter for knowledge building, and shifts to discuss design of knowledge building analytics. A demo of building analytic tools with the new Knowledge Forum APIs will be provided and several design documents will be presented. Through extensive discussion and collaboration among the participants, we expect to bring together a coherent conception of knowledge building analytics, a few new designs of analytic tools, and a few teams who are motivated to implement their designs with the API.</p>

<p>A brief yet systematic review of analytic tools developed for knowledge building and Knowledge Forum will be presented at the beginning of this symposium, to inform later discussion and design of next-generation knowledge building analytics.</p>

<h3>
<a name="a-conceptual-framework-of-knowledge-building-analytics-epistemology-assessment-and-more" class="anchor" href="#a-conceptual-framework-of-knowledge-building-analytics-epistemology-assessment-and-more"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A conceptual framework of knowledge building analytics: Epistemology, assessment, and more</h3>

<p>Exploring epistemological assumptions is critical for developing analytics (Knight, Buckingham Shum, &amp; Littleton, 2013). Epistemology, concerned with “the nature of knowledge,” may implicitly dictate what we assess. This presentation will survey epistemological underpinnings of knowledge building and their implications for design of analytic tools.</p>

<h3>
<a name="knowledge-building-indicators-that-matter" class="anchor" href="#knowledge-building-indicators-that-matter"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Knowledge building indicators that matter</h3>

<p>This interactive section will start with a short review of important knowledge building indicators present in literature (e.g., Zhang &amp; Sun, 2011). Then we will open up discussion for knowledge building indicators that matter.</p>

<p>While it is important to ensure the attainment of educational goals, to address 21st century needs of education also calls for the discovery of new competencies; “[r]ather than simply extrapolating from existing goals or expert-identified objectives, new goals can emerge from the capacities that students demonstrate in supportive environments” (Scardamalia, Bransford, Kozma, &amp; Quellmalz, 2012). This section will discuss designs to support the emergence of new competencies that go beyond current “best-practice” in the field of learning analytics.</p>

<p>Decision making in analytic tool design is less related to aesthetics than to underlying theories. This interactive section will begin with an articulation of this argument, with case studies of analytic tool design. Then participants are invited to form small groups, with a favourable mix of researchers, teachers, designers, and programmers if possible, to tackle specific design problems of their choice.</p>

<a name="building-analytic-tools-with-knowledge-forum-apis" class="anchor" href="#building-analytic-tools-with-knowledge-forum-apis"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building analytic tools with Knowledge Forum APIs</h3>

<p>The new Knowledge Forum API allows flexible implementation of analytic tools. This section will feature a demo of the API in a number of programming languages (including Java, Python, and R). After this demo, participants are encouraged to work with their teams to implement design ideas during this symposium and the rest of the conference as well.</p>

<p>Well designed analytics do not warrant improved knowledge building in a community. It has been recognized that the design of learning analytics interventions should go hand in hand with analytics so that tools, data, and reports are taken up and used properly (Wise, 2014). How do teachers and students perceive designed analytic tools? How do we harness the power of algorithms while granting enough epistemic to knowledge builders? How should we organize dialogues around analytic tools? This section will explore issues in design of pedagogical interventions to empower teachers and students to maximize the usefulness of analytics.</p>

<p>We expect this symposium to catalyse dialogues and collaboration on knowledge building analytics. We look forward to keep our dialogues and implementation efforts going during the conference. By the end of the conference, we hope to hold a debrief of the outcomes of this symposium.</p>
