Agenda
======

Because of the time constrain, the 1.5 hour symposium featured presentations of three key issues: conceptual frameworks, design, and implementation of analytics. Then participants self-organized into three small groups to discuss analytic tool design.

1. __Introduction__ ([slides](files/0-Intro.pdf))
2. __A conceptual framework of knowledge building__ ([slides](files/1-Framework.pdf))
3. __Design of theoretically-informed analytics for knowledge building__ ([slides](files/2-Design.pdf))
4. __Building analytic tools with Knowledge Forum APIs__ ([slides](files/3-KF-API.pdf))
5. __Small-group work!__
6. __Synthesis and reflection__
